This example demonstrates the SurveyJS ability to correctly recognize and apply localized strings of choice items obtained from a RESTful service as a response JSON.  
In this sample, the `test.json` file emulates the JSON received from a web server. It is specified via a checkbox question's `choicesByUrl` property.  

Click the "Change language" button to switch the current locale (from "en" to "de") and see how the checkbox question's choices translation changes.
